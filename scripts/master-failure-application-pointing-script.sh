Subject: Alert,demodata and demodatacms applications pointed to new master server

FYI, Mysql service from master was not accessible. Took necessary action and tried to restart it but could not able to start it so ran mysql promote scripts on slave server and pointed all FEs to new master.
Please check log files for more details.
